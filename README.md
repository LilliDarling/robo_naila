## 1. About the Project

This project aims to build a personalized AI companion robot inspired by devices like EMO or Vector. The goal is to create an interactive and intelligent robot that lives on your desk, providing companionship, entertainment, and utility, all powered by local, privacy-focused AI.

By leveraging powerful local AI models and efficient communication protocols, NAILA aims to offer a low-latency, responsive experience without constant reliance on cloud services for the time being.

## 2. Features & Capabilities

NAILA as a robot is designed to offer a range of intelligent and interactive features:

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) & Conversation:**
    * **Wake Word Detection:** Responds to a custom wake word to initiate interaction.
    * **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Transcribes spoken commands and queries into text using **`faster-whisper`** (running a `tiny.en` or `base.en` Whisper model).
    * **Large Language Model (LLM) Processing:** Engages in dynamic, intelligent conversations and answers questions using a local LLM (**Llama 3 8B Instruct** via `llama-cpp-python`).
    * **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Generates natural-sounding voice responses using the **`Llama-OuteTTS-1.0-1B-GGUF`** model (also powered by `llama-cpp-python`), allowing for unique voice characteristics via speaker referencing.

* **Interactive Presence:**
    * **Expressive Display:** Utilizes an integrated screen for animated eyes, expressions, and on-screen information.
    * **Motorized Movements:** Enables head tilts, body movements, and other gestures to convey emotion and attention.
    * **Responsive Audio:** Plays sounds and speaks directly to the user.

* **Environmental Awareness:**
    * **Basic Vision Processing:** Utilizes a camera for basic object detection and recognition using **`Ultralytics YOLOv8 Nano`**. This can enable the robot to identify people, pets, or specific objects in its vicinity.

* **Maintainability & Updates:**
    * **Over-The-Air (OTA) Firmware Updates:** Allows for easy wireless updates to the robot's embedded firmware directly from the local server.

## 3. System Architecture

- **Vision Processing:** Basic computer vision tasks and camera management
- **Motor Control:** Servo positioning and movement coordination
- **Communications Manager:** WiFi connectivity and protocol handling
- **OTA Updates:** Over-the-air firmware update capability

**Communication Infrastructure:**
- **MQTT Server:** Central message broker for asynchronous communication
- **HTTP Server:** Web services for data access, logs, and device management
- **Real-time Data Flow:** Bidirectional communication between all components

**AI Orchestration Layer:**
- **Main Agent:** Primary decision-making and conversation flow control
- **Personality Agent:** Manages character traits and behavioral responses
- **Context Agent:** Maintains conversation context and situational awareness
- **Memory Agent:** Handles long-term memory and user personalization
